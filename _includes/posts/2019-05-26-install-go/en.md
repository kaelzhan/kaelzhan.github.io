# Installation
Go is supported on all the three platforms Mac, Windows and Linux. You can download the binary for the corresponding platform from https://golang.org/dl/

## Mac OS
Download the OS X installer from https://golang.org/dl/. Double tap to start the installation. Follow the prompts and this should have Golang installed in /usr/local/go and would have also added the folder /usr/local/go/bin to your PATH environment variable.

## Windows
Download the MSI installer from https://golang.org/dl/. Double tap to start the installation and follow the prompts. This will install Go in location c:\Go and will also add the directory c:\Go\bin to your path environment variable.

## Linux
Download the tar file from https://golang.org/dl/ and unzip it to /usr/local.

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. This should install Go in linux.

In the next part Golang tutorial part 2: Hello World of this series we will setup the Go workspace and write our first Go program :)
